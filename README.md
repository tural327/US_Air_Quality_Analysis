# Overview

About the Air Quality Index
The EPA developed the AQI, which reports levels of ozone, particle pollution, and other common air pollutants on the same scale. An AQI reading of 101 corresponds to a level that is above the national air quality standardâ€”the higher the AQI rating, the greater the health impact. The AQI is divided into color-coded categories, and each category is identified by a simple informative descriptor. The descriptors are intended to convey information to the public about how air quality within each category relates to public health. The table below defines the AQI categories.

# Data Visualization

Firstly, lets sea how much time we measured AQI quality

Most clean and the most unclean state of usa

 For the next step i find mean value for each month and made sisualizations

  # Forecasting with SARIMAX
  
  Before building model I devided dataset 3 sections 
  1. old data - I will not gonna use for my model 
  2. Train data - I will use for training use for my model 
  3. Train data - I will use for training use for my model

   Next lets visualise data for finding seasonal or not
